Notes on RCMx1 when doing firmware bringup.

* Wrong processor used - need the larger part (get part number for Jim) with PWM 9 and 10
* Silk screen for GPIO and Analog needs to be re-thought
* Mapping of analog and GPIO needs to be updated - create map of current code for Tim and approve
* ADC values should never be able to go negative.
