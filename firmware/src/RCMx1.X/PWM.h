 * This firmware runs all of the functions of the RCMx1 I/O expander board
 * The RXMx1 connects to the SRV-1 Surveyor Blackfin Camera board via I2C
 * and listens for commands from the SRV. It has analog inputs, digital I/O,
 * RC Servo outputs, and h-bridge motor driver outputs. It also breaks out all
 * of the SRV-1 bus signals.
