Got version RCMx1_v01 from Tim (who got it from Jim) - 10/29/2014.

Updated to v02 with the following changes: (10/29/2014 - BPS)
* Changed fiducal marks so they had the copper restrict layer pulling back the copper the full 0.04".
* Changed R19 from 499K to 499 ohms (error only in DigiKey Part Number field of BOM)
